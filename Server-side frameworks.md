# Server-side framework comparison
## Django
### Advantage
- Suitable for making blog like website (e.g instagram)
- Good for making shopping or real estate website
- Fastest to make backend application
- Best for CRUD
- Has the most libraries
- Has the biggest community, so developer can easily get help
- Has good security
- Good at handling image and short video (1 minute)
### Disadvantage
- Bad for making real-time backend application
- Bad at handling long video (2 minutes~)
---
## NodeJS
### Advantage
- Can develop backend using JavaScript
- Fast for handling simple events like clicking button in the web page
- Good for making website that mostly use text than media to interact (e.g chat application)
### Disadvantage
- Use **single thread**, and CPU keep changes tasks. So if a specific task needs lots of computation, then application stop and won't proceed to next task
- Bad at handling algorithm that takes many CPU cycles
---
## Spring
### Advantage
- Use multithread, so good at processing tasks simultaneously
- Has large community, so can get help easily
- Good at heavy computation
- Good security
- Fastest in performance among backend frameworks, when code is ready
### Disadvantage
- Takes long time to write code
- Slow when compiling code
- Overall, development process is very slow
---
## Go
### Advantage
- Can compute heavy algorithm
- Good at multithreading in CPU
- Faster than Java at compilation
### Disadvantage
- Has small community, so it is hard to get help
- Does not have many modules
---
# Other programming languages
## C++
### Advantage
- Can make fastest backend application and operating system
- Has many library to support mathematical computation like data science
- Good at handling real time request
- Good for making database or network application
### Disadvantage
- Need to manage main memory manually
- Takes long to develop application
---
## Rust
### Advantage
- Can make backend application and operating system like C++
- Good for making database or operating system or network application
- Safer than C++
- Faster than other programming languages
### Disadvantage
- Slower than C++
